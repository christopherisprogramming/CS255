DriverPass, led by Liam and Ian, wanted a system for better driver training. They needed it to handle ​online classes, practice tests, and on-the-road training. The system​ ​should​ manage user registration, and appointment scheduling. It must follow DMV rules and offer different user roles. Liam shared specific ideas for the system's look and features 
I think I did a good job understanding what the client wanted for their system. My notes show that I got a clear picture of what they needed and how they wanted things to work. It's important to understand what the client wants so we can make sure to give them what they need. 
	If I were to improve something, I'd focus on enhancing the UML diagrams and similar visuals in Project Two. I could make them more detailed by adding additional elements and information to accurately represent the system's structure and functionality. This would provide a clearer picture of how different components interact and ensure that the design meets the client's requirements comprehensively. 
	Understanding and incorporating the user's needs into the system design involved careful analysis of the client's objectives, functionality requirements, and user expectations. Prioritizing user needs ​is essential​ as ​it directly impacts the​ system's usability, effectiveness, ​and overall​ success, ultimately leading to better-designed systems that deliver value to both the client and the end-users. 
	In designing systems and analysis, I start by thoroughly analyzing project requirements and objectives, ensuring a clear understanding of client needs. For future development, I will use techniques like UML diagrams and user stories to visualize system architecture while prioritizing flexibility, scalability, and usability to create robust solutions.
